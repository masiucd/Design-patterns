## About <a name = "about"></a>

A simple example of using a OOP design in Typescript.
How does the _new_ keyword works and how _this_ keyword is used when working with a more _OOP_ code paradigm.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

```bash
  $ git clone <URL>

  $ cd into project

  npm/yarn install

```

## What is the `new` keyword doing for us when constructing a new object?

**The new keyword will insert a bunch of different stuff for us, 3 main things!**

- **this** will be bound to a empty object. Create a empty object and assign to this
- sets a hidden property which is **underscore underscore proto underscore underscore** sometime call _dunder proto_
- final thing it will automatically return out object from the function

## **\_\_proto\_\_\_**

What is going on when we call a method that does not exists on the object itself but we declared the method on the prototype like this:

```js
  function User(name.age){
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }

  const u1 = new User("bob",21)

  User.prototype.birthday = function(){
    this.age++
  }

```

You will probably thing it will go straight forward to the prototype but that's not how Javascript works.
It will _panic_ for a bit when it can't find the method itself on the `u1` object.
Luckily javascript has something that calls `dunder proto` which then will go and check if the `birthday` method actually exists on the `User.prototype` and then call the `birthday method`.
