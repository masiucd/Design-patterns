## What is the `new` keyword doing for us when constructing a new object?

**The new keyword will insert a bunch of different stuff for us, 3 main things!**

- **this** will be bound to a empty object. Create a empty object and assign to this
- sets a hidden property which is **underscore underscore proto underscore underscore** sometime call _dunder proto_
- final thing it will automatically return out object from the function
